                        <p>Tamawa Environment Initiative has obtained the Buy-In of both the Schools of Agriculture and Environment at BUK, our local university. This arrangement will include the participation of the Departments of Agronomy and Agricultural Economics. This Buy-In represents a unique opportunity for Tamawa Environment Initiative to introduce university staff and more importantly students to rural farmers thus combining both a sociological bridge as well as an agricultural one, wherein the two normally separate communities – academia and subsistence level farmers will intermingle in a way that both groups could gain from the other. </p>
